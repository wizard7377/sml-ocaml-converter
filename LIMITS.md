# Limations of the Project 

During this project, due to time constraints, I had to deal with a number of issues in ways that some might find unsatisfying.
This ultimately made me decide to create a rough framework for what this is *supposed* to do.
1. The OCaml program must be a reasonable and human readable translation of the SML
2. The OCaml program, if correct, should be an equivalent of the SML
3. Names should be mangled as little as possible 
4. Changes should always work or not happen at all 
5. Files must be converted as units, without regard to context
