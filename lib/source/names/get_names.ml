(** Implementation of AST name extraction.

    See {!Get_names} for the public interface documentation.

    {b Note}: This is currently a stub implementation that will be filled in
    as the name extraction logic is developed. The implementation will need
    to recursively traverse all AST node types to extract names. *)
